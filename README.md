A very WIP python module to allow reading and import of Ced File System (CFS) electrophysiology files generated by 
the signal software suite: http://ced.co.uk/products/sigovin.

## Install

```python
import pyCEDFS

cfsfile = pyCEDFS.CFS('debug.cfs') #Loads the file 
sweep1 = cfsfile.dataY[channel][sweepnumber,:] #data is loaded into dataY and dataX attributes.
y_units cfsfile.chVars[channel]['units'] #Other variables can be fetched from var dictionaries
```
